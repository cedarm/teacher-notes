From [Sage Reynolds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gc9wnUCfIk&index=2&list=PLD7C33982F6FF2019)' video series

## Choose paper size and imposition
 - Consider grain direction and number of folds

## Printing the book
 - Imposition

## Folding and gathering the signatures
 - Fold
 - Gather
 - Stack gatherings
 - Measure and mark hole positions
 - Pierce all holes if desired

## Sewing the binding
### Tips
 - No more than ~5 signatures of thread
 - Always pull along spine to prevent tears
 - Always flip next signature onto stack
 - Always check signature or page number

### Sewing
 - Sew first signature
 - Insert tapes
 - Sew second signature
 - Square knot together
 - Third and beyond, kettle stitch at each end
   - Push needle toward outside between lower two signatures
   - Then pass up through loop and tighten
   - Press signatures down while tightening
 - Use sheet bend to extend thread
 - Last signature, kettle stitch at end twice

## Tipping on Endpapers
 - Endpapers are same size as book block
 - Glue ~1/4" along fold, one side
 - Line endpaper up with first signature
 - Keep workspace clean
 - Use a gluing pad

## Making headbands
 - Outside face of fabric down
 - Glue top edge of fabric around a cord
 - Work it so bottom is flat
 - Top with cord will hang over the book block

## Gluing the spine
 - Apply glue to whole spine
 - Work from center toward outside
### Rounding the spine
 - Wait till glue is not tacky, but still cool
 - Bend book to fan edges, then hold
 - Hit between kettle stitches first, then outside
 - Flip and round other side
 - Mind the symmetry

## Lining the spine
### Mull
 - Cut mull to fit between kettle stiches
 - Cut lining paper, same length as book minus ~1/8"
 - Apply glue to whole spine
 - Apply mull and rub in well
### Headbands
 - Use residual glue to measure headband lengths
 - Cut headbands
 - Apply headbands with more glue
### Marker ribbons
 - ???
### Paper lining
 - Apply more glue to whole spine
 - Apply lining paper, aligning to center and front edge
 - Wait until proper glue tackiness
 - Rub lining paper in
 - Flip book and rub other edge
 - Fold back and rub crease
 - Apply a little more glue between first and second layer of lining paper
 - Rub down, flip, rub other edge
 - Fold back and tear off excess
 - Rub down feathered edge

## Making the case
### Cutting the boards
 - Square a corner
 - Line up book head with squared corner
 - Leave ~3/8" from spine
 - Trim other two sides
### Making the gauge
 - Line up boards on each side of book as when complete
 - Measure with scrap around spine and crease
 - Transfer measurement to gauge
 - Cut width with extra 1/16" - 1/8" (based on fabric thickness)
### Cutting the cover material
 - Place boards on material, spaced by gauge
 - Leave ~3/4" margin around boards
 - Cut lining paper to span gap between boards
   - Plus 1" onto each board
   - Same height as boards
### Gluing the cover
 - Apply glue to back of cover material
 - Place first board, gauge, second board, then remove gauge
 - Apply glue to lining paper
 - Apply lining paper to gap
 - Crease and press down well into corners of gap
 - Cut corners at 45 degrees
 - Fold top and bottom edges of cover material over and pinch down
 - Set the corners
 - Fold sides over and pinch down
 - Rub down all edges
 - Flip over and set the hinge joints
 - Place book inside case
 - Set the hinge joints again
 - Let case dry around book
### Gluing the end papers
 - Keep work area clean
 - Watch out for drips
 - Use block to keep book raised from work surface
 - Always brush from center out and off of edges
 - Keep book square with cover boards
 - Apply glue under tapes and glue down
 - Apply glue under mull and glue down
 - Apply glue to end paper
 - Fold cover around spine and close
 - Flip book and repeat for other side
 - Place book in press briefly
 - Remove and inspect
 - Rub down edges of end papers
 - Crease hinge again slightly
 - Place book in press or under weights to dry
